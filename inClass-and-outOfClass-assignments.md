# In class and Out of class assignments

## Jovani Cardenas Tapia and Peter Tsun

An in-class assignment is to use NetLogo to construct a graph paper
using recursions of drawing squares.

An out-of-class assignment is to use NetLogo to construct a graph
paper using recursion of drawing rectangles.

The graph paper can be used for plotting experimental data.
